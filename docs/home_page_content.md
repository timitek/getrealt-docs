## Populating Content with the Blog Editor

When you click on of the create / edit buttons, you will be taken to the **blog editor**.  Even though you may not be interested in creating a blog, the blog editor is used to create content for these various sections on your website.  The blog editor allows us to associate tags with content you create.  Notice the instructions within each section that is able to be edited. There is mention of tagging a blog post with a specific word in order to have the content show up in this provided section.  This is how you are able create custom content within these sections on your home page.  

Content can be created with multiple tags associated with it to allow it to appear in multiple sections within the website.

Some of the sections also provide special instructions for icons and images if used as the first element in the content.  Example, the **feature** section will prominently display an icon above it's section if an icon is provided as the first element in the content.  A testimonial will prominently display an image beside the testimonial if it is the first element in the content. Icon's can be inserted into the content by selecting the "icon editor" from the blog editors toolbar (*represented by the smiley face*).

You can create / edit this contact information just like the other sections on your website.
